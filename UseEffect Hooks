Prerequisites

Familiarity with the use state hook is recommended.
A previous video on the basics of hooks is linked for reference.


Key Concepts
Resource Type Selection

Users can select a resource type: posts, users, or comments.
The selected resource type is displayed dynamically.

Side Effects

The use effect hook is used to handle side effects in function components.
Unlike class components, function components do not have lifecycle methods.

Basic Usage of useEffect

The basic syntax involves passing a function to useEffect.
Example:useEffect(() => {
    console.log("render");
});


Reacting to Changes

The effect runs every time the component renders.
To run the effect only when the resource type changes, it can be passed as a dependency:useEffect(() => {
    console.log("resource type changed");
}, [resourceType]);


Mounting Behavior

An empty array as a dependency means the effect runs only on mount:useEffect(() => {
    console.log("on mount");
}, []);


Simplified Side Effects

The dependency array allows for a simpler approach to managing side effects compared to lifecycle methods.
Example:

If values change, the effect runs:useEffect(() => {
    // effect logic
}, [value1, value2, value3]);




API Querying

The video demonstrates querying an API based on the selected resource type.
The URL is constructed using template strings to include the resource type.

Example of Fetching Data

The initial fetch logs data based on the selected resource type:

Posts: 100 entries
Users: 10 entries
Comments: 500 entries

No additional fetch occurs if the resource type is not changed.

State Management

The fetched data is stored in state using useState.
Example:const [items, setItems] = useState([]);


Rendering Fetched Data

The fetched items can be rendered by mapping through the state.

Conclusion

The use effect hook is a powerful tool for managing side effects in React function components.
Understanding how to use it effectively can simplify component behavior and data fetching.

Summary of Use Effect Hook in React
Overview of Use Effect Hook

The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects in React components.
It allows for dynamic updates based on changes in state or props.

Basic Example

Initial Setup:

Use JSON.stringify to display items (posts, users, comments).
Modify state based on changes using useEffect.

Window Width Example:

Set up a state variable for window width.
Initially set window width to window.innerWidth.
The value updates only on refresh without additional setup.



Listening to Window Resize Events


Event Listener Setup:

Use useEffect to add an event listener for resize on component mount.
Create a function handleResize to update window width.

Cleanup on Unmount:

Use a return function in useEffect to remove the event listener when the component unmounts.
This prevents memory leaks and performance issues.



Resource Type Changes


Dynamic Resource Handling:

The useEffect can run every time a resource type changes.
Use console.log to track changes and cleanup actions.

Cleanup Functionality:

The return function in useEffect acts as cleanup for previous setups.
Ensures that event listeners or subscriptions are removed properly.

Key Takeaways

The useEffect hook is essential for managing side effects in React.
It can handle various scenarios like component mounting, unmounting, and state changes.
Proper cleanup is crucial to maintain performance and avoid memory leaks.

Conclusion

The useEffect hook is a powerful tool in React for managing side effects.
